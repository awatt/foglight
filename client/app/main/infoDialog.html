        <p>The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”) has shed new light on the murky financial relationships
          between U.S. prescribing doctors and the pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.  Enacted as part of the Affordable
          Care Act (“ACA”), the Sunshine Act compels pharmaceutical companies to file annual disclosures of all gifts, meals, drug samples, speaking fees, teaching fees, author fees, research grants and other forms of payment made to prescribing doctors.  The data, beginning in mid-2013, is hosted in downloadable form by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/" target="_blank">Open Payments website</a>.</p>

        <p>Open Payments embodies the growing pubic awareness of the conflicts of interest implicit in these ties.  In 2009, the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), <a href="http://iom.nationalacademies.org/Reports/2009/Conflict-of-Interest-in-Medical-Research-Education-and-Practice.aspx" target="_blank">reported</a> data suggesting “that these relationships may influence physicians to prescribe a company’s medicines even when evidence indicates another drug would be more beneficial.”  The NAM report urged greater transparency and recommended “eliminating these problematic relationships between physicians and industry.”</p>

        <p>While Open Payments is a major step towards transparency, a <a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1170047" target="_blank">recent University of Colorado study</a> found “negligible to small” deterrence effect of the disclosure laws on physicians’ prescribing habits, citing, among other reasons, the fact that “although these payments were disclosed to state agencies, payment information was not disseminated to the public in an accessible way.”</p>

        <p>PharmLens uses data visualization tools to provide a more accessible and transparent public interface with Open Payments data, specifically in the subset of diabetes-related drugs.</p>
